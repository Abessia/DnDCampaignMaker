There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## D&D Campaign Creator ##
Empowers DMs with total control to create campaigns inspired by published random tables

## Summary ##
Make full use of the wealth of random tables in the published D&D materials to design creative, innovative camapigns.  Retain full control of your creative process by being able to roll on the tables, directly select a choice, or edit the campaign document directly to make it your own.  Choices from the tables will auto-populate into the campaign document where you can change them to your heart's content.  You can export the document or save it for later use.

## Problem ##
Currently, the random tables in the DMG and other published materials are scattered across hundreds of pages, and require the DM to write the results out by hand or type them themselves into their note-taker of choice.  Further, there is no integration between the wealth of published materials on dndbeyond and the DMs ability to leverage those materials in a way comparable to dndbeyond's character creator and encounter builder.  

## Solution ##
This seeks to fill the gap identified above and, eventually, should allow the inclusion of links to encounters, characters, and dndbeyond's native campaign manager.  Finally, dndbeyond's authentication system alongside open-source authentication methods available within the dnd developer community will allow this app to ensure that users have access only to the resources they've purchased.  Eventually, the app will allow users to insert their own user-made tables for homebrew options that integrate seemlessly into the creator itself.  Further export options (.pdf, for example) will come with subsequent implementations.

## Quote from You ##
You have a character creator and an encounter builder -- now, welcome to the campaign creator: all the power of digital D&D resources leveraged to help you create innovative, exiting adventures and campaigns!

## How to Get Started ##
Simply open the app, create your account, connect it to your dndbeyond account, and the campaign creator will give you access to all the tools you need to make amazing campaigns for your table.

Parker: "Before, I had to stack 5 books on my desk and waste time looking through them for the different tables & resources, and then waste more time scratching down notes to myself.  The campaign creator puts it all in one place and automates the process, saving me time and letting me focus on making a great game for my players." 

So what's left to do?  Go sign up and make the campaign of your dreams, easier than ever!
